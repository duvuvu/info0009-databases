## Project 1
The train schedule management system aims to provide a centralized, structured way to store, manage, and retrieve information about railway schedules. The system handles main components such as agencies, routes, stops, trips, and services while ensuring data integrity. This project provides the entity-relationship diagram, relational schema, integrity constraints, and normalization process to design a database for managing railway schedules.
