## Project Highlights

* **myDb.sql**: Creates all required tables with constraints and loads CSV data.
* **views.sql**: Implements all views used in Tasks 4, 5, and 6.
* **All tasks (2â€“8)** implemented in separate, clearly structured PHP files.
* **Transactions** and **constraint validation** are handled carefully:

  * Time logic in trips
  * Bounding box enforcement in stop edits
  * Referential integrity on itinerary deletions
* **Route IDs** are dynamically generated following the required pattern.
